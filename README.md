nopress
=======

* nopress is *NOT* a static site generator.
* nopress is a [single page webapp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) and file-system based CMS.
* nopress does render web pages on client-side(browser) rather than server-side.
* nopress uses (my favorites):
    - [jade](https://jade-lang.com)
    - [less](http://lesscss.org)
    - ~~[marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for [github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)~~
    - [commonmark](http://commonmark.org) on behalf of original [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* that's all folks ;)

may the *SOURCE* be with you.
